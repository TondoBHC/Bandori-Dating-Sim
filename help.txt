    "Classes are still a drag, and I’m relieved when the bell rings. The hallways are loud and swarming with people, so I just try and blend in."
    "I look around the hallway for those colourful characters from yesterday but they are nowhere in sight."
    "Oh right! I almost forgot that there was a library, so I can camp out there for the rest of break until I meet new people."
    "I trail along to the library and see a colourful poster on the door."
    "For a poster made by high schoolers, it’s surprisingly full of spirit and creativity. It’s so detailed that the drawings remind me of something, but what?"
    "The host club! I clap my hands and rush over to the club room specified on the poster, the jolt in my body resounding in my footsteps. I beam at the clubroom door, and yank it open."
    user "Holy shit."
    "It’s official, Haneoka is made of money if they can support THIS kind of room. It must’ve costed a fortune."
    "My eyes hunt the room for Tomoe and her blazing red hair, but I’m instead met with electric blue hair."

    "Hina drifts around the room, humming blissfully. It’s almost like she isn’t carrying a heavy box; it’s impressive that she can move so weightlessly. She seem to do everything so effortlessly..."
    "She seems oblivious to my presence, and I begin to wonder if it would be best if I just left. Afterall, I feel like I’ve just rushed into this, I haven’t even planned on what to say."
    "But just as I was about to leave..."

    "Hina’s box dives to the ground, the items knocked out messily. She stares at me, incredulously, before her eyes twinkle wildly."

    "In a fever, she swings herself over to me, and snatches my hands up, grinning. She dances maniacally around the room, spinning me around, beaming brightly all the way."
    "I slump onto the couch she swivels me onto and catch my breath – does she greet every guest this way? Hina is still breathless, but is bouncing on her like nothing ever happened."
    $ k = "???"
    k "Ah, what’s this? A guest you say?"
    "Hina veers toward the captivating voice. A familiar voice."

    "My head shoots up, and my glance meets the tall, suave Kaoru yet again. She slides next to me, brushing herself against me."
    "Strangely, my dizziness seems stronger with Kaoru’s allure than with Hina spiralling me around the room, but I digress."
    user "Actually, I’m not here as a, er..., guest. I’m here to -!"
    "A squirm slips out of my mouth as I feel warm hands enveloping in mine. Shakily, my head slowly shifts to Kaoru, who winks at me as she caresses my hand."
    user "Gak!"
    "I whimper out, as Kaoru boldly sneaks a kiss at my hand. My face must be as red as a tomato. Kaoru laughs at my reaction."
    k "I’m glad you came to the host club, my little kitten."
